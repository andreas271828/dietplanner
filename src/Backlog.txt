-   New strategy:
    Create three meals that have an optimal combination for 2 full days and I can create mostly by cutting things in the blender and heating them up.
    One day is more flexible (can be spread out over the week): eating out, fasting, cooking something special
-   Improve looking for meal template combinations; move ingredients between meals; make direct connections between properties and scores and search for ingredients that influence them.
-   Refactor code; remove unused code; improve threading with SwingWorker; see TODOs.
-   Write tests (to test correctness but also execution time; avoid randomness; e.g. calculating requirements; use JUnit?).
-   Create user interface.
-   About, warnings and information (calculation of requirements / meaning of limits, only a calculator, ask a professional, use organic products and ethical sources, water, water filter, different types of fat, heating fat, cholesterol, intermittent fasting [http://mysportsdconnect.com/category/sports-nutrition-podcast/], third-party information, names are from database - peel, cook etc. where appropriate)
