-   Improve optimisation algorithm
    test5()
-   Adjust score function for costs (upper limit for optimum > 0.0, so that the algorithm doesn't try to reduce costs unnecessarily in favour of optimising nutritional values)
-   Refactor code; see TODOs
-   Improve and use custom meal templates
-   Write tests (to test correctness but also execution time; avoid randomness; e.g. calculating requirements; use JUnit?)
-   Create user interface (run evolutionary algorithm in background)
-   Improve parameterisation, calculation of criteria (consider TODOs, "Ketogenic diets and physical performance.pdf", No-Meat-Athlete-Cheat-Sheet1.jpg, http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php), etc.
-   About, warnings and information (only a calculator, ask a professional, use organic products and ethical sources, water, water filter, different types of fat, heating fat, cholesterol)
-   Parallel computation
