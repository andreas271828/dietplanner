-   Make adjustments to meal templates, parameters, optimisation algorithm and printing until I get a useful diet plan for myself.
--- POC complete: Develop business.
-   Refactor code; remove unused code; see TODOs
-   Write tests (to test correctness but also execution time; avoid randomness; e.g. calculating requirements; use JUnit?)
-   Improve optimisation algorithm (higher diversity? subpopulations / species [for different combinations of meal templates]? variable mutation rates? optimise individual scores?)
-   Create user interface
-   Improve parameterisation, calculation of criteria (consider TODOs, "Ketogenic diets and physical performance.pdf", No-Meat-Athlete-Cheat-Sheet1.jpg, http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php), etc.
-   About, warnings and information (only a calculator, ask a professional, use organic products and ethical sources, water, water filter, different types of fat, heating fat, cholesterol)
-   Parallel computation
