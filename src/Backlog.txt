-   Improve optimisation algorithm
        Start with random minimal meals.
        Add random portions of random ingredient to random meal.
            If score doesn't improve try half the added portions. Repeat.
            If even 1 added portion doesn't improve the score, continue with a different meal / ingredient (remember ingredient that can't be improved anymore).
        Repeat adding ingredients until all ingredients of all meals are marked as being being able to be improved anymore.
        Repeat creating diet plans this way until there is an initial population of diet plans.
        Run evolutionary algorithm.
-   Refactor code
-   Improve and use custom meal templates
-   Write tests (to test correctness but also execution time; avoid randomness; e.g. calculating requirements; use JUnit?)
-   Create user interface (run evolutionary algorithm in background)
-   Improve parameterisation, calculation of criteria (consider TODOs, "Ketogenic diets and physical performance.pdf", No-Meat-Athlete-Cheat-Sheet1.jpg, http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php), etc.
-   About, warnings and information (only a calculator, ask a professional, use organic products and ethical sources, water, water filter, different types of fat, heating fat, cholesterol)
-   Parallel computation
