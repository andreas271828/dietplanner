-   Make adjustments to meal templates, parameters, optimisation algorithm and printing until I get a useful diet plan for myself.
    Restrictions for fat, protein and sugar make it hard to get enough energy.
    Creating candidates for individual scores resulted in more diversity and I think produced scores > 111.07 quicker than using only the total score.
        Probably, the start population needs a bit more diversity!!!
    Remove batch to avoid calculating contribution potentials too often?
        Is removing slowing down the process extremely, or is the algorithm actually not improving convergence?
            Slowed down by about 10x?
    Current record for total score: 111.07656656698126 of 112.0
--- POC complete: Develop business.
-   Refactor code; remove unused code; see TODOs
-   Write tests (to test correctness but also execution time; avoid randomness; e.g. calculating requirements; use JUnit?)
-   Improve optimisation algorithm (higher diversity? subpopulations / species [for different combinations of meal templates]? variable mutation rates? optimise individual scores?)
-   Create user interface
-   Improve parameterisation, calculation of criteria (consider TODOs, "Ketogenic diets and physical performance.pdf", No-Meat-Athlete-Cheat-Sheet1.jpg, http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php), etc.
-   About, warnings and information (only a calculator, ask a professional, use organic products and ethical sources, water, water filter, different types of fat, heating fat, cholesterol)
-   Parallel computation
