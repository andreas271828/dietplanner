-   Analyse and improve optimisation algorithm using custom meal templates.
-   Improve and add custom meal templates.
--- POC complete?! Does it work for me? Look for joint ventures / business partners / investors?
-   Refactor code; remove unused code; see TODOs; use threading
-   Write tests (to test correctness but also execution time; avoid randomness; e.g. calculating requirements; use JUnit?)
-   Improve optimisation algorithm (higher diversity? subpopulations?)
-   Create user interface (run evolutionary algorithm in background)
-   Improve parameterisation, calculation of criteria (consider TODOs, "Ketogenic diets and physical performance.pdf", No-Meat-Athlete-Cheat-Sheet1.jpg, http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php), etc.
-   About, warnings and information (only a calculator, ask a professional, use organic products and ethical sources, water, water filter, different types of fat, heating fat, cholesterol)
-   Parallel computation
