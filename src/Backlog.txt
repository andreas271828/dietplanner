-   Don't add items with amount = 0 to lists
-   Weight requirements (e.g. first of all the amount of energy must be about right)
-   Create more meal templates
-   Review food item portions
-   See TODOs
-   Improve evolutionary algorithm (ensure genome diversity)
-   Write tests (to test correctness but also execution time; avoid randomness; e.g. calculating requirements; use JUnit?)
-   Create user interface (run evolutionary algorithm in background)
-   Improve parameterisation, calculation of criteria (consider TODOs, "Ketogenic diets and physical performance.pdf", No-Meat-Athlete-Cheat-Sheet1.jpg, http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php), etc.
-   About, warnings and information (only a calculator, ask a professional, use organic products and ethical sources, water, water filter, different types of fat, heating fat, cholesterol)
