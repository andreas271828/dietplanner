-   Make adjustments to meal templates, parameters, optimisation algorithm and printing until I get a useful diet plan for myself.
    Restrictions for fat, protein and sugar make it hard to get enough energy.
    Creating candidates for individual scores resulted in more diversity and I think produced scores > 111.07 quicker than using only the total score.
    TRY: First, create individuals using only the total score. Then, create additional individuals that are optimised for the worst score.
        Attention: Those new individuals and even combinations with existing ones might have a worse total score and problems to survive!
        Work in phases and create a new start population by combining new individuals and existing ones at the beginning of each phase?
--- POC complete: Develop business.
-   Refactor code; remove unused code; see TODOs
-   Write tests (to test correctness but also execution time; avoid randomness; e.g. calculating requirements; use JUnit?)
-   Improve optimisation algorithm (higher diversity? subpopulations / species [for different combinations of meal templates]? variable mutation rates? optimise individual scores?)
-   Create user interface
-   Improve parameterisation, calculation of criteria (consider TODOs, "Ketogenic diets and physical performance.pdf", No-Meat-Athlete-Cheat-Sheet1.jpg, http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php), etc.
-   About, warnings and information (only a calculator, ask a professional, use organic products and ethical sources, water, water filter, different types of fat, heating fat, cholesterol)
-   Parallel computation
