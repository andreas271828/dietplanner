-   Implement waste criteria properly (see TODOs).
-   See TODOs in DietPlan.getScores() and define limits (e.g. maximum amount of potatoes).
-   Try and adjust (prices, meal templates, ...).
-   Refactor code; remove unused code; improve threading with SwingWorker; see TODOs
-   Write tests (to test correctness but also execution time; avoid randomness; e.g. calculating requirements; use JUnit?)
-   Improve optimisation algorithm:
    Most experiments haven't shown significant improvements of the scores or convergence speed.
    What could be useful, is to focus on one score in each population, rather than on the total score in all of them.
-   Create user interface
-   Improve parameterisation, calculation of criteria (consider TODOs, "Ketogenic diets and physical performance.pdf", No-Meat-Athlete-Cheat-Sheet1.jpg, http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php), etc.
-   About, warnings and information (calculation of requirements / meaning of limits, only a calculator, ask a professional, use organic products and ethical sources, water, water filter, different types of fat, heating fat, cholesterol, intermittent fasting [http://mysportsdconnect.com/category/sports-nutrition-podcast/], third-party information, names are from database - peel, cook etc. where appropriate)
-   Parallel computation
