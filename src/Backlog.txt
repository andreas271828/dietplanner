-   Improve optimisation algorithm
        Improve recursive algorithm - it needs to spread the search out more.
            Try 1 step several times (with all ingredients as next test case?) before going deeper with the best one?
                Remember the total score of all of them - continue with next best when finished with best?
            Randomly fork branches, compute in parallel and kill least successful ones regularly?
-   Refactor code
-   Improve and use custom meal templates
-   Write tests (to test correctness but also execution time; avoid randomness; e.g. calculating requirements; use JUnit?)
-   Create user interface (run evolutionary algorithm in background)
-   Improve parameterisation, calculation of criteria (consider TODOs, "Ketogenic diets and physical performance.pdf", No-Meat-Athlete-Cheat-Sheet1.jpg, http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php), etc.
-   About, warnings and information (only a calculator, ask a professional, use organic products and ethical sources, water, water filter, different types of fat, heating fat, cholesterol)
-   Parallel computation
