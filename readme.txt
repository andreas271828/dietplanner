DietPlanner
===========

This software can help to create diet plans according to the user's needs and preferences.
I have experimented with many different algorithms and parameters and developing the software has helped me a lot to
understand many details of nutrition.
Currently, there is no proper user interface and the hardcoded parameters mostly reflect my own needs and preferences.

As written in the license agreement, I want to emphasise also here that this software comes without any warranty.
Nutrition is an extremely complex topic and this software as well as the parameters used will not actually be able to
create a perfect diet plan for many reasons. On the other hand, our bodies are quite robust and many imperfections do
not matter too much. While this software might not be able to create an optimal diet plan, I'm confident that it can
help users to get closer to the optimum.

FIX: Add usage information and information about code.
